It is  also now evident that  mass electrical supply through grid networks is no  longer a realistic  and feasible reality for much of the world&rsquo;s  population. Furthermore,  the worldwide threat of climate change is  becoming increasingly  apparent, as the international community realizes  the need to  dramatically change the way it is developing and living if  its impacts  are to be minimized. The promotion and dissemination of  solar power can  help to address the above, by providing innovative  energy solutions  for remote communities, while also reflecting a  development strategy  that is sensitive to global environmental concerns.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Small scale solar installation projects  offer a direct, safe and environmentally friendly way to provide modern  electricity to communities across West Africa. With solar, community  health clinics can have vaccine fridges, schools can hold night-classes,  individuals can listen to radios, water can be pumped for agriculture,  and households can be lit up; meanwhile burdens such as water and fuel  collecting are dramatically reduced. Solar power is an appropriate  technology to engage with and improve the livelihoods of West African  communities, while also being reflective of the global need to have a  development process which has a minimal impact on global environmental  commons. EFO&rsquo;s work with solar is thus a reflection of a development  strategy that is appreciative of both local and global concerns.</p>',33),('<p>Six photovoltaic solar panels installed at a District Council Administrative Building, Kambia Town, Kambia District.</p>',50),('<p>Energy For Opportunity&rsquo;s two founders first met while living and working  with Community Based Organizations in rural Uganda. This was an  experience that introduced them both to the unique challenges that the  African environment can present in the development and implementation of  community-driven sustainable projects. This initial collaboration led  to further opportunities in Sierra Leone and Liberia through work with  the Environmental Foundation for Africa, where they implemented a  large-scale solar electricity installation project in twelve schools and  health clinics in refugee affected areas across Liberia. This was soon  followed with further solar installations on Tiwai Island, an  eco-tourism and research site in the south-east of Sierra Leone.</p>\r\n<p>The above projects were not only a great success, but also provided a  variety of learning experiences relating to the challenges and  opportunities that&nbsp; the implementation of renewable energy projects in the  region could present. It was evident that renewable energy was being  heavily underutilized in West Africa, a technology that could play a  major role in addressing deficit in energy supply that the majority of  the region&rsquo;s populace face. Energy For Opportunity naturally grew  out of these experiences, the creation of an organization that aims to <em>effectively</em> and <em>efficiently</em> disseminate renewable energy to areas in Africa where the need is  greatest. The organization has continued to evolve as other partners have  joined and contributed their experiences and areas of expertise.</p>',34),('<p>EFO\'s Director Simon Willans conducting a training workshop in eastern Uganda</p>',57),('<div>\r\n<p>Energy For Opportunity&rsquo;s strategy is to develop innovative ways in which to both promote and implement the use of renewable energy. The emphasis therefore is not only on direct solar installation projects (in health clinics, schools, community centers etc.), but also on solar training for students in partnership with local education institutions and the active promotion of the use of renewable energies in the offices and projects of government bodies and international organizations. Thus the objective is not just to deliver renewable electricity through projects, but also instill a philosophy of renewable energy use across the broader community.</p>\r\n<p>EFO focuses its work exclusively in West Africa, a region where the need for alternative forms of energy is greatest. It is a region that the United Nations ranks as having eight out of the twenty least developed countries in the world. Energy For Opportunity has established a locally managed regional office in Sierra Leone and is developing programs with other local partners in West Africa. The strategy being to establish long-term partnerships, with EFO providing any necessary expertise and support while increasing local technical capacity. This strategy is derived from EFO&rsquo;s belief that any international organization working in a development setting should be striving to make their services redundant; the involvement of local partners is one key step in this process.</p>\r\n<p>Please utilize the link below if you wish to find out more information about our base country:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a title=\"Sierra Leone Development Profile\" href=\"http://efo.webfactional.com/site_media/media/files/documents/sierra-leone-development-profile.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sierra Leone Development Profile</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>',37),('<p>Map of West Africa</p>',56),('<h2>Donation FAQ:</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>1.

Kamabai is one of only three regional test centres for both the BECE and WASCE examinations, the standardised tests used in the Sierra Leone education system. The installation was driven by community contribution both financially, from revenue generated from the community charging station installed in March and through community participation in the installation - digging trenches and the earthing pit and assisting to lift the panels up onto the roof.<br /><br />The installation provides study light for the school\'s evening classes as well as providing light for extra study time in the evenings. The installation now lights up 11 rooms, the lab, a chapel, a community library, outdoor security light and provision for computers school hall and energy for computers in the library.<br /><br />Since the installaions the students, staff and Principal of Kamabai and Kamakwie Senior Secondary Schools participated in an evaluation of the solar installations and their impacts on learning Results indicated that the solar lights installed in the school have brought a number of economic benefits for the school\'s administration, teachers, parents and students alike, as well as increasing the safety and security around the schools and replacing the school\'s reliance on petrol fuelled generators. Staff and students expect the lights will also improve performance in the senior secondary and university entrance exams as students will be able to safely study in the school at night, where they have access to text books.<br /><br />The system has been an exciting development for the students as the majority do not have electricity in their homes. &ldquo;When we come to school and the weather and big storms are all dark we can go into the hall and continue our work&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->',2,NULL,2,'AusAID','1320',1000,3000,'2011-04-01'),(4,'gbendembu-baptist-secondary-school','2011-08-13 17:15:29','2011-08-15 22:47:28',1,1,'Gbendembu Baptist Secondary School','The installation at Gbendembu Secondary School in May 2011, was a great team effort from start to finish.

In an initial survey of the site in April 2011 by Simon, EFO&rsquo;s director, and Jalloh, EFO Programme Manager, with Abdul K. Koroma (AKK), the site manager alongside them, they established that the site would be suitable for a solar irrigation system. The land slopes over an acre area, down to a well at the bottom of the site.<br /><br />After the project was given the technical go ahead, the installation was carried out over a five day period from the 9th to the 13th of May, 2011. Training on installation and basic maintenance was incorporated into the installation by Jalloh, with practical on-the-job training followed by evening classes with a notepad and pen in the outdoor classroom (a selection of rocks at the top of the site that form a seating area). This gave a great sense of ownership of the project to the labourers and site leaders as well as being a practical tool in case of the need for basic maintenance of the system.<br /><br />AKK who has led the efforts to bring a solar irrigation system to the Kamaso site was delighted to see the finished product and is convinced that it will make a huge difference in their day to day work, and will positively affect crop yields too. The irrigation system consists of 2x175 Watt solar panels that pump water up from a well to two big tanks (3000 L and 2000 L) at the top of the site. From there, the water is easily pumped through a maze of watering pipes that zig zag across the land. In the rainy season this is not such a necessity but when the extended dry season comes around from October through to May, the system will be a huge help to the labourers who previously used to water the crops by hand every three days. With this system the crops will have constant irrigation even through the hottest days of the dry season, thanks to the deep well at the bottom of the site.<br /><br />Solar irrigation systems are a new venture for EFO, and this one will be closely monitored for performance so that the system can be improved if need be and to inform any future irrigation installations.</p>\r\n<!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --><!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->',7,NULL,4,'','350',NULL,NULL,'2011-05-31'),(10,'river-number-2-eco-tourism-resort','2011-08-14 14:24:25','2011-08-15 22:57:02',1,1,'River Number 2 Eco-Tourism Resort','In May 2011, EFO  installed 8x175 Watt solar panels to electrify the community run tourist attraction of River No. 2, an off-grid coastal community on the Western Area Peninsula, near to Freetown.

It has certainly been a busy time, sometimes frustrating, often exhausting but ultimately successful and things are really moving forward.\n\nThe very first week back I headed up-line to try and secure registration for EFO in Bombali and Koinadugu Districts, our two planned focus areas. A friend of mine had been working on the national level registration but the main body responsible for this seems to be unsure when they will start registering new organisations and suggested the local route. So off we went, with a couple of vague contacts, some fry-fry and a few bundles of water. After two long days on the road, going back and forth between council offices, chief’s houses and other random pit stops we successfully got both registrations and are now officially registered as a Non-Governmental Organisation in both Districts. We are still chasing the national level registration as it gives you much more legitimacy and also allows you to import equipment much more simply but for now at least we can work!\n\nDuring the trip I managed to fit in two site visits for the Inveneo project and also meet with staff from CAUSE Canada about possible future collaboration. The Inveneo project came about while I was back in Canada and this was my first time seeing the sites to really get an idea of what the work will look like. Some things were much worse than hoped, ie no actual wiring in the one building, but overall we can fit in the solar power very easily and it will certainly help out both organisations. I had done some work for CAUSE when I was with EFA and we are discussing some possible links between their microfinance work and various solar electricity options, if we can get the concept right it can be a great fit.\n\nBack in Freetown…the last two weeks have been filled with planning, meetings and general running around. Unfortunately, the house/temporary office isn’t quite ready for occupancy so I’ve been running things from a guesthouse with a cell phone modem. Luckily, this guesthouse is on the beach which means good views, fresh fish and the option to go swimming at any time but also comes with a lot of distractions. I’ve attached a few pictures of the place, you can see it isn’t too bad really but I will be very happy to get into a more permanent home. Hopefully the house/office will be finished this week and I can get settled in properly.\n\nOn the work side we are making our preparations for the training programme at GTI and there should be two solar electricity courses being taught this year. The introductory class will be taught by one of the GTI staff who I trained last year and I will be back in the classroom in January teaching an Advanced Design class. Solar Energy International (<a href=\"http://www.solarenergy.org/\">http://www.solarenergy.org/</a>) has been extremely supportive of the programme and has provided two partial scholarships, some textbooks and is also helping arrange the Biofuels trainer who will come over near the end of the school year. We have also secured our second project, providing the solar electricity system for an installation at an orphanage in Kamakwie. This is a bit of a rush and is expected to happen in late November, but once again will be an excellent project to be involved with.\n\nThat’s about where we are these days. There are all sorts of potential opportunities coming up and with the hope of finally securing our charitable status in Canada we can really make a push on the fundraising front which will allow us to get some significant work done this year. I’ll try to keep the updates coming…look for some early next week from our installations in Makeni.\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1136\" title=\"View From the Office\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Office-front-view-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"View From the Office\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /> <img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1138\" title=\"Office main 1\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Office-main-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Office main 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2009-10-19 19:26:54','2009-10-19 19:26:54',11,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:01',1,'','','Makeni installations are complete!','This past weekend we traveled up to Makeni to do the first two installations as EFO!

We have been working on the system design with Leslie for over a year but this was the first time we had actually been to the site.\n\nThe school serves as both a Junior and Senior Secondary school and operates on a shift basis, with JSS in the morning and SSS in the afternoon. There are over 1150 students and the school is also the regional testing site for all three of the standardised tests that are part of the Sierra Leone school system. We received a very open welcome from the two Principals, Mr. Brima Conteh and Mr. Martin S. Kamara and they provided excellent input into the priority areas for the school and how best to secure the system.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1187\" title=\"KSS#3\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/KSS3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"KSS#3\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1185\" title=\"KSS#1\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/KSS1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"KSS#1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n\nThe final planning is still underway but if all goes well we should be back up in Kamakwie in mid-February for this project. It is definitely going to have an immediate impact for the students and there are plans being developed on how the system can serve the greater community.','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2009-12-13 11:22:47','2009-12-13 11:22:47',16,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:01',1,'','','Kamabai - Planning...the not as exciting side of work','Fresh off our work in Kamakwie we made a quick side trip to Kamabai to do some overdue planning work.

Kamabai and Kamakwie are likely to be our main two hubs of activity, as they are two of the  largest Chiefdom Headquarter towns in Bombali District and home to two of the three Senior Secondary Schools in the District outside Makeni. This was our first time in Kamabai, despite passing the village tens of times on the way to or from Kabala.\n\nWe were escorted to Kamabai by and old friend and work colleague from Lakka, Foday Presto Koroma who was born and raised in the village. His brother and his family gave us a place to stay, fed us and supplied us with the (soon to be) world famous Kamabai poyo. The next day we met with the acting Chief, PC Modi Brima, and other local stakeholders and elders. As always, we were given a warm welcome and quickly made to feel at home in the community. After our meeting we spent hours touring the community and surveying all of the major community structures that were identified as priority areas for electricity. This included the Secondary School, health centre, court barri, market and three primary schools. It was an exhausting day but a very, very productive one and hopefully the start of a successful partnership between EFO and the people of Biriwa Chiefdom.\n\nTo see some photos of the site visits go to our facebook page at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60927992298\">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60927992298</a>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2009-12-15 08:56:04','2009-12-15 08:56:04',17,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:01',1,'','','80016 8551?!','What is this you ask...just the sweetest numbers ever to be heard by Energy For Opportunity!

The modules are en-route now and we are hoping to have them installed in time for the standardised tests at the end of the school year.\n\nOut back Power Systems has come forward with an incredible donation of two, FX2024 (2000W) inverters, one MX60 charge controller and also allowed us to purchase the balance of system components at close to cost price, enabling us to buy all the necessary circuit breakers and other accessories for the systems. It was an extremely generous donation and combined with the BP solar panels, almost completes the first school system(either Kamabai or Gbendembu) and gets us started on the second! These have also reached our shipper in the USA and will soon be in transit to Sierra Leone.\n\nIt is through this kind of support that we can keep building the programme. We still need to raise another $5000 to buy the electrical cables, batteries and other accessories for the first school installation but this certainly moves us much closer to our target.','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2010-04-23 18:56:30','2010-04-23 18:56:30',31,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:02',1,'','','Kamakwie and Kamalo: Phase II','We are heading up-country again on Monday to finish the AusAID project.

We were there for a couple of days and it also gave me the chance to stop by the orphanage and school to see how the systems were performing and more importantly if they were being used and what impact they were having.\n\nAt the orphanage everything was working smoothly and although the rains have started and the power is less, the staff have figured out how to manage it effectively and were rationing the power to ensure it was there when needed. The panels were still being washed and the computer lab Yossi set up was being used by the children for watching films, learning basic programmes and also for photo editing!\n\nWe also stopped over at the school unannounced one evening to see how things were going there. We had heard that there had been some developments but were shocked by the activities! The school has organised a series of night classes for both the JSS and SSS students and they are being taught and attended daily. It is also time for the WASC exam, the standardised test students sit prior to going to university or post secondary school. Between the classes and students studying for the WASC there were at least 200 students on campus spread out in six of the classrooms. I talked to Mr. Conteh, the Principal and he also informed me that afternoon computer classes were scheduled to start this week and all the task lights Leslie had bought for the school had been bought by staff and students and they were ready to place an additional order. Perhaps even more important than these quantifiable actions, there was a noticeable excitement and pride among the staff and students in their school and the opportunity that the solar power had provided.','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2010-05-07 09:08:45','2010-05-07 09:08:45',33,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:02',1,'','','Energy For Opportunity...back in the Lakka community','After a tough week of up-country work a relaxing week of office work would have made sense to most.

This was the first step in the only emergency response service available to people within Haiti during this critical period. When not working with EFO I am a graduate fellow at Stanford, where I research methods for processing large volumes of short messages in less-widely spoken languages and crowdsourcing technologies for language processing. This experience, combined with my development work with EFO, proved vital here. The primary emergency responders were the US Military, who for the most  part did not speak Haitian Kreyol or know the locations of addresses in  Haiti. Working with two other organizations that had their starts in Africa, <a href=\"http://medic.frontlinesms.com/\">FrontLineSMS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.org\">Ushahidi</a>, we designed a system that allowed volunteers from anywhere in the world to come online and translate, geolocate and categorize emergency messages in real-time.\n\nThis allowed us to turn raw text in Haitian Kreyol into categorized English messages with precise coordinates,\nwith an average turnaround of about 10 minutes. According to the responders this saved hundreds of lives and directed the first aid to tens of thousands. The mapping component of our service, hosted by Ushahidi,\nquickly became the most reliable source of real-time crisis data.\n\nI worked with more than 1000 volunteers in the first weeks alone - incredible, dedicated people working day and night to help, and helped coordinate the transfer to the long term technological and staffing partners, <a href=\"http://crowdflower.com\">CrowdFlower</a> and <a href=\"http://www.samasource.com\">Samasource</a>.

In conjunction with the site evaluations Ame and Mohamed conducted community engagement sessions with 277 people across the 6 villages and collected preliminary data regarding the use of fuels for cooking and lighting in the chiefdom. The research has indicated that contrary to popular belief and the most recent Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey Report (2007) battery operated torches are the primary sources of fuel for lighting in this remote area and not kerosene.

These systems are very, very similar to ones we have tried in Sierra Leone and we have seen many of the same results. The situation is a bit trickier here in that the rural population tends to have less and more seasonal income than Kenya but there are other less expensive, two light systems that fill that gap. One of the very insightful things from the article is that the system was bought primarily to charge the household mobile phone and lighting was secondary! Once again we have seen similar things here and are trying to utilise that as a way to spur small scale businesses in these communities, while also highlighting the costs savings, compared to kerosene, candles, and battery based lighting that these systems offer. Without any overstatement, these systems really are kicking off a revolution in how rural lighting and power can be provided! \n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/article?a=719675&f=110','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2010-12-28 11:18:00','2010-12-28 11:18:00',51,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:03',1,'','','Forbes Blog Post on Energy For Opportunity\'s Work','Forbes recently held an interview with Energy For Opportunity\'s Director Simon Willans.

Typically, Sierra Leone has one growing season and this leads to some hard times before harvest. By introducing the water pumping/irrigation we are hoping to add additional growing opportunities during the dry season and also expand the amount of land that can be farmed by moving away from time consuming hand watering. The initial funds are also being used to buy seeds for high value vegetable crops such as carrots, cabbage and peppers which can bring in substantial revenue to the farmers. The project is being supported through Travis\'s own hard work and donations from friends and family, with EFO helping with the technical side of things and also managing the overall project. It is just in the very early stages but things are off to a good start, with a strong and eager team on the ground!<a href=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/16-Sign-12.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1644\" title=\"Koinadugu\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/16-Sign-12-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3-AKK-happy-with-the-work-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1650\" title=\"Working\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3-AKK-happy-with-the-work-3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5-Cabbage.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1647 aligncenter\" title=\"Cabbages\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5-Cabbage-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-02-09 17:49:28','2011-02-09 17:49:28',53,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-05-02 10:33:03',1,'','','2010 Annual Report','Energy For Opportunity is excited to announce the release of its 2010 Annual Report.

ENFO provides energy to disadvantaged rural communities, trains students about how and why to use solar energy and promotes it as an appropriate form of energy to build a positive future for West Africa. In order to expand its work in other energy sectors, ENFO needs up to date statistics on energy consumption in Sierra Leone which is largely fuelwood dependent.  To address this need ENFO has recently (April 2011) started a seven-month study on the timber and fuelwood and timber markets in Sierra Leone in order to reveal patterns of energy use in the country as well as understand their contribution to land cover change. This project is being funded through the FAO&rsquo;s, Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Support (FLEGTS) programme and considering no major research has been undertaken on forest cover in Sierra Leone since the 1980s and 1990s and no in-depth research on the fuelwood market has been conducted since the 1980s, this an important knowledge gap to fill.   The key objective of the proposed research is to build a greater understanding of the nature and impacts of domestic timber and fuelwood harvesting and marketing patterns as well as issues surrounding their regulation in Northern Sierra Leone and Freetown. ENFO will also identify the household energy consumption needs and patterns of Sierra Leoneans which is currently heavily dependent on fuelwood. In making accurate, independent information available it is hoped that the social and ecological dynamics of forest resource management will be improved here.  Existing research focuses exclusively on the Freetown, whereas this project will adopt a phased approach to produce a national map of fuelwood harvesting and trade, in Northern Sierra Leone and Freetown to begin with, followed by a second phase in Southern and Eastern Sierra Leone. The project will also focus on the dynamics of the domestic timber trade in the key ecological areas surrounding Outamba-Kilimi National park, the Gola Forest Reserve and the Western Areas Peninsula Reserve.  ENFO is dedicated to capacity building in Sierra Leone and has integrated a strong capacity building component into this project. Nine research assistants are currently undergoing training in research methodologies as part of an intensive recruitment process before final selections and fieldwork begins. They will be involved in all aspects of data collection throughout the project. Their skills development is critical to capacity building in the area of forest management in Sierra Leone.  <img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1679\" title=\"Pic#1\" src=\"http://www.energyforopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Pic1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> The research and training is being led by Energy For Opportunity&rsquo;s head researcher, Mr. Hiemstra-van der Horst, a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who has significant field experience and has written several scholarly publications around fuelwood and timber production and consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa.   After an initial student training period, the research will begin a regionally phased approach in the collection of data. There will be a rapid national assessment, followed by an in-depth study in Northern Sierra Leone and Freetown. ENFO will subsequently apply for funding to complete the research in the southern and Eastern Provinces.  Senior ENFO staff, namely Simon Willans, ENFO&rsquo;s Executive Director, Greg Hiemstra-van der Horst and Paul Munro, a PhD candidate and co-founder of ENFO, will oversee key aspects of data gathering, will provide critical analysis, organise the collected data and develop reports and publications.</p>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-04-23 09:56:46','2011-04-23 09:56:46',56,0,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-08-17 05:02:42',1,'','','Kamabai Secondary School','Phase two of one of the Kamabai Secondary School Solar electrical installation has been completed.

By 7.30, we had successfully navigated through the mayhem of Freetown and were on the open road. We made good time and by 10.00 a.m. we arrived at EFO&rsquo;s Makeni office. We met Maggi and he showed off his nice new quarters beside the office. The office itself is light, airy and spacious with simple wooden furnishing and some colourful touches of material covering cushions and seats making it a very pleasant space. After collecting a few things, most notably, our trustee fellow colleague Jalloh, we were ready to continue on our journey into the hills of rural Sierra Leone.</p>\r\n<p>When we pulled up into Kamabai, a community that has been supported by EFO since March 2010, throngs of children greeted us. We all bundled out of the car to a warm welcome with many the inquisitive tug on the wrist or clothes for attention. A quick inspection of the charging station revealed that it is a successful enterprise. About forty phones and several rechargeable lights were charging, with a table of rechargeable lights on display in front of the station. A solar-lit market hall, bustling with women and small children sits adjacent to the charging station and Simon later told me that this charging station had earned enough to pay for solar panels to be installed into the local secondary school, our next port of call. Kamabai secondary school has approximately 800 pupils and is located near to the centre of Kamabai. The six solar panels installed on the central building provide light for the classrooms as well as providing enough power for a future computer lab. We took a tour around the classrooms and adjoining church and chatted to the principal briefly. Some students were milling around even though it was a public holiday so we took the opportunity to take some photos before continuing up the Makeni-Kabala highway, stopping briefly to buy Simon&rsquo;s favourite, cow milk!</p>\r\n<p>The road twisted and turned as we climbed to higher ground through the tree-topped hills, nearing Kabala. The relative drop in temperature was a relief. In Kabala, we checked into Paygays Guest-house before returning back the way we came some distance to Kamaso, the first of three sites for a gardening project being run by a local man, Abdul Koroma. Simon and Jalloh needed to inspect the plots and look at the water supply situation to see how solar pumps could be used for irrigation purposes. The first plot which looked lush with crops, was situated on high ground sloping down to a well area. The well was deemed suitable for installation of a water pump by the EFO experts.</p>\r\n<p>The next plot we visited, Kasumpe, was situated on lower ground and was nicely cultivated with a selection of vegetables including carrots and lettuces. Three or four workers were weeding or harvesting, with a solar powered radio balanced on a bush keeping them company. Abdul Koroma showed us the well that had been dug and explained that it was problematic because the earth is too high in clay content so when they dug deeper the walls began to collapse. In discussion with Simon and Jalloh, it was agreed that Abdul should get a quote for a concrete well to be built. We moved on to the final site, which is a proposed site, inspected the well which looked good and walked back out to the small village where the car was parked. We bumped and jolted back onto the main tar road and drove back to Kabala for the night. In Kabala we met with a District Council representative who agreed to help Abdul to get a quote for a concrete well to be constructed. We all sat down together for a meal of tasty bean sauce and rice in the evening, had a few drinks and discussed the day.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, Friday the 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;of April, the District Council rep. introduced us to a well construction expert and Simon, Jalloh and Abdul accompanied them to the site to make a quote. The quote was more than expected at 25 million leones (approx $5813). An informal meeting was convened in Kamaso with the gardening hands and Abdul to discuss the three sites. We sat around on rocks overlooking the Kamaso plot and discussed how to go forward. It was recommended by Simon that they think carefully about spending a lot of money on constructing a well. In terms of the cost of getting helpers to water the plots at Le 250,000 per month it would take eight years for the well to pay itself off. In this sense, he suggested that they should either get the well constructed for a much more reasonable price or decide to pay people to water the plots manually. Abdul and the rest of the workers agreed that they&nbsp;would try to get a cheaper quote for the well before making a decision. They also decided that they would like to have the solar pump installed in Kamaso before the rainy season. Jalloh agreed to come and do the installation. We said our goodbyes to Abdul and his co-workers and set-off on the long and treacherous road for Freetown.</p>\r\n<p>Just after Kamabai we had our final adventure of the trip. We came upon a group of people who had just gotten out of a car that was parked on the side of the road. A very drunk and obstinate driver was in the driver&rsquo;s seat refusing to get out and trying to convince his passengers to get back in. We stopped alongside and after a bit of persuasion the driver finally got out. Discovering that it was an automatic car Simon offered to drive back to Kamabai with the passengers. The driver protested and at first tried to push, in a drunken haze, to come along with us. We refused and left him on the side of the road to make his own way to the police station where Simon was going to park the car. Simon&rsquo;s change of profession from NGO director to taxi driver was the cause of much hilarity as we finally set off back to Freetown.</p>\r\n<p>We arrived back tired and dazed after two days of travel but satisfied to have seen some of EFO&rsquo;s project sites and to have had some fun and adventures along the way!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-08-17 05:03:11','2011-05-24 05:03:11',58,1,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-08-17 06:17:28',1,'','uploads/ENFO-in-the-sand-River-No.2-compressed-300x200.jpg','Solar Installed into community led tourism resort - River #2','A team of EFO solar technicians, Idrissa, Sheka and Alusine have finished the installation of eight solar panels to electrify the community run tourist attraction of River No. 2, an off-grid coastal community on the Western Area Peninsula, near to Freetown.

The solar installation will provide light and will power a freezer and some light appliances in the store area, kitchen, restaurant and huts providing accommodation to tourists. EFO is delighted to provide River No. 2 with solar power as it will facilitate smooth running of the facility as well as boosting the community&rsquo;s efforts to attract tourists by reinforcing their image as an&nbsp;eco-tourism attraction. An expert on sustainable tourism, Mr. Robert Travers, recently completed a study on Sierra Leone&rsquo;s tourism sector and concluded that, due to Sierra Leone&rsquo;s natural and unspoilt beauty, Sierra Leone should prioritise eco-tourism and brand itself as the centre of eco-tourism in West Africa. The National Tourist Board here also has plans in the pipeline to support several eco-tourism sites in Sierra Leone but River No. 2 is not included, making this support all the more necessary. The solar installation looks fantastic, placed in the centre of the facility for all arrivals to see, and will definitely promote River No. 2 firmly to the status of &ldquo;community run eco-tourism resort&rdquo; which in turn, we hope, will attract more tourists.</p>\r\n<p>The installation has been supported by the EU funded project &ldquo;Conservation of the Western Area Forest Reserve (WAPFoR) and its watershed&rdquo;, being implemented jointly by Welt Hunger Hilfe (WHH) and the Environmental Forum for Action (ENFORAC). The project aims to limit the pressures on the Western Area Peninsula Forest by its use as a source of fuelwood and other livelihood activities, by promoting alternative livelihoods such as eco-tourism, to forest edge communities, such as River No. 2. ENFO is proud to be able to provide the expertise to support the achievement of the protection of the Western Area Peninsula Forest as well as helping local communities to thrive&nbsp;and develop sustainably.</p>\r\n<p>The EFO team arrived on Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and spent a day hard at work putting the initial wiring down, with the community assisting in digging trenches to lay down the wires to connect the store, kitchen, restaurant and huts. Alusine showed his competence by efficiently and neatly laying a neat web of wiring (earth mat) at the bottom of the pit that was dug, whilst Idrissa and Sheka moved around the different buildings wiring them up and fixing plug sockets and light fixtures. By the end of the day, a lot of the hard work had been done. They left for a few days in between to allow the community to prepare a base in an open area for the solar panels to be mounted on, and on Tuesday the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;they came back to finish the job. By Thursday evening the job was completed and all the buildings were successfully electrified. (Incidentally, this article is being written from the office beside the River No. 2 store, with newly fitted sockets!)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-08-17 05:06:52','2011-07-17 16:17:02',59,1,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-08-17 06:14:54',1,'','','ICSB 2011 World Conference','Energy For Opportunity is currently participating in the International Council for Small Business 2011 World Conference.

Auntie  Emily who runs the orphanage is delighted with what she has seen in the  last year. According to Emily, &lsquo;&rsquo;children from schools in Port Loko come  to study in the evenings and two children from the orphanage got the  best grades in their class in their last exams&rsquo;&rsquo; thanks to the solar. In  recent exams, Sonita Conteh and Christiana Sesay got the highest grades  in their classes and their fellow student, Johnson Kanu, came second in  his class (they are proudly pictured on the right). An average of sixty children from Port Loko come to study in  the evenings which means the orphanage is proving to be a social  amenity that benefits the wider community, not only the children and  staff of St. Martins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The charging station that was incorporated into the system is  operating well and as of August 2011, the previous month&rsquo;s profits were  SLL 1,100,000 ($255). The charging station is providing employment for  Gabriel Turay, a young local man who manages the charging station and  meticulously records all of the phones that come in and out.&nbsp; An average  of 60 to 70 phones are charged per day with the customer base coming  from the surrounding population and a recent influx of road workers. The  charging station profits are set aside for maintenance, upgrades and  replacement parts for the solar system as well as supporting the  orphanage.&nbsp; Aunty Emily is also considering expanding their income  generating activities by buying a second fridge / freezer so that she  can sell cold drinks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The generous support from the Arts Foundation, headed by Mark Arts  from the Netherlands, has been vital to the success of this project. In a  recent EFO visit, Aunty Emily showed us into their newly established  computer room where computers donated by the Arts Foundation have been  set-up for the children to use. They are a valuable asset to the  children at St. Martin&rsquo;s, giving them the opportunity to learn skills  that are essential in our modern world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The children were all happily weeding a plot of ground-nut plants  when we pulled into the secondary school compound to visit them where  their ground-nut crop is located. According to Aunty Emily, &lsquo;&rsquo;it&rsquo;s  important for the children to be busy during the holidays&rsquo;&rsquo; so two days a  week they help with weeding the plants that will later be harvested for  use at the orphanage. The children were curious to see the three white  people walking in and gathered together excitedly for a group picture.  We left Port Loko with a conviction that the solar system installed just  over a year ago is having a positive impact on the lives of the  children as well as on the wider community.&nbsp; Aunty Emily must be  commended for running St. Martin&rsquo;s so well, providing a shining example  for others.</p>\r\n</div>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-08-17 07:12:35','2011-08-11 07:12:35',61,1,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0),(2,'2011-08-19 22:46:42',1,'','','Solar Power - Sierra Leone','Here is a link to an interesting article on solar power in Sierra Leone,&nbsp;http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers?','solar-power-sierra-leone','<p>Here is a link to an interesting article on solar power in Sierra Leone,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers?</a></p>','2042-03-15 00:00:00','2011-08-19 22:45:34','2011-08-19 22:45:34',62,1,0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html',0);
